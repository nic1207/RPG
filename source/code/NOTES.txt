NEXT STEPS:


- do next:

Make collision correction dependant on previous location and velocity
Give all entities an ID (tag)
Make array of entities to loop through
Remove each entity as you go through loop





Make non-tile entities with physics (Hoppy physics can help) If moving diagonally and blocked in one direction, still go in other direction (slide)
- Collision with player causes message and cc.log from callback
- Player push at full speed
- Entity slows player with force
- Entity collides with map
- Entity collides with all entities
- Resolve complex collisions
- Diagonal Movement
- Give Entities collision states (including player)

ADD ENTITY LOGIC:
- Drive in a direction.
- If hit wall, turn



Make custom loading scene or overlay for in between levels


Make load and end scene - NOTE: Commented out game menu code in SCGameMenu calls the playGame method on load for some reason.

Make the scene manager work properly

Make touch friendly movement and UI


Make custom loader scene for beginning.

look for this._logoTexture
Put into config file
Extend cc.Loader?????






give each entity a Mediator to broadcast events only to itself???

Add tracing messages that are rebroadcast, number of listeners and list of them, ability to turn logging on/off

add proper player movement using physics, velocity, etc

add physics logic with a loop that is passed the list of all game entities. No gravity for now, but can add later. 


player has a moveTO function like grave peril?


- Make the map / payer movement and animation work on events / messages

- Need to be able to pass listeners and callbacks back to the mediator when a message is sent from it
- test the message system a lot

-- 

- MAKE ALL THIS BASED ON THE MESSAGE SYSTEM
- Basic player movement (tap to move only or hold to move?)
- Basic tile map meta data layer read in (movement only)
- Player movement based on tile map meta data
-
